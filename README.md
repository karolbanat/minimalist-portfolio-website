## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I would like to spend more time on planning with design before starting to code. In this project i spend a lot of time, but I still feel it wasn't enough.
While coding I had to change my mind a few times, so spending more time on planning would save me some time.
I would like to work on naming classes and files too. I think I don't spend enough time on thinking about names.
